# godot-pong
I made a version of the classic game Pong using Godot engine 4.0 as part of the "20 games challenge" exercise. 

My main goal for this was to learn more about developing games with the Godot environment. 

By making Pong, I've learned more about collision handling, using signals (Godot's implementation fo the observer pattern), ways to play audio and how to implement a "pause" functionality in Godot.

I wanted to try using the state pattern to navigate between the game states (playing, paused and finished). I know this is not the most common use of this design pattern and problably there's a better way to do this, but I wanted to try anyway and compare to other ways of implementing menu/state navigation in the future.

This was also the first time I tried making music. I made a very basic track to serve as background music to the game.

To make things different, I've also made the game in a vertical window instead of the usual horizontal one.
